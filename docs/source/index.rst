Abstract
--------

This project tackles the simulation of coupled electrostatic and mechanical phenomena in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) devices, whose widespread adoption in contemporary technologies makes accurate yet efficient modeling essential.

Full-order numerical solvers quickly become computationally prohibitive for realistic geometries, and in such cases one of the possible solutions could be relying on reduced-order modeling.

Indeed, we choose to do so: we construct an idealized test case that preserves the key physical features, then we develop a reduced-order model based on recent Deep Learning–based ROM (DL-ROM) techniques, in particular DeepONets, exploiting an approximation of mechanical deformation grounded in Euler–Bernoulli beam theory in order to design it to interface with a finite-element solver for the mechanical response.

A brief literature review frames our methodology within current trends in MEMS modeling and data-driven model reduction.
